In this project, I applied the machine learning technique we learned about in Bootcamp 2 to a dataset of banknotes and wrote an API where a client can input some measurements of a banknote into the URL, and have a response returned regarding whether the banknote is authentic or not. I thought this was an interesting dataset because it has practical applications to the real world, and was a manageable size to work with.
